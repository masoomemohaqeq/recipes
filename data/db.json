      "description": "Not a day goes by that I don’t eat a little chocolate. Usually, I savor a square of dark chocolate after dinner, but in the summer I crave a bite-sized chocolate frozen treat. Cue frozen chocolate-covered bananas: two bites of sweet and creamy banana enrobed in a thin dark chocolate shell. I like to make chocolate-covered bananas in the afternoon so that they are ready in time for an after-dinner treat.",
      "method": "Cover a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper. Add 2 inches of water to a double boiler or small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the water is simmering, turn the heat down to low. Meanwhile, peel the bananas, trim the ends, and slice them into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange evenly spaced on the sheet pan. Wipe off the knife and cutting board and finely chop the chocolate. Add the chopped chocolate and canola oil to a small heatproof glass or metal bowl that fits snugly over the pan of simmering water. Place the bowl on top of the pot of water and use a flexible spatula to stir the chocolate until melted and no solids remain, about 2 minutes. Coat the tines of a fork in melted chocolate and set a slice of banana on top. Use a flexible spatula or spoon to spoon chocolate over the banana slice, completely covering it. Nudge the banana slice to the front of the fork and scrape the bottom of the fork against the side of the bowl, removing excess chocolate.",

Since woks have a small base with steep walls, this allows the egg foo young to shallow fry without adding too much oil. Since the base is smaller than a frying pan, it also helps prevent the omelet from spreading too quickly and thinly.",

      "description": "If you crave a good iced coffee in the summer, but loathe the way so many end up tasting watery or overly bitter, then there's only one solution: cold brew coffee. This method guarantees a smooth and icy cup, every time.\n\nMaking cold brew coffee is no great secret, nor does it require the ninja-level skills of a trained barista in order to master. You don't even need much special equipment beyond a large container for making the coffee and a strainer.",
      "method": "Here's how it works: Grind the coffee coarsely, which you can do yourself at home or wherever you buy the beans. Combine the grounds with water, then let it steep overnight, or for around 12 hours.\n\nDuring this time, the coffee slowly infuses into the water, creating a strong, concentrated brew. Strain the next morning, and you're ready to go.",

      "description": "If you’re like me, your childhood was spent trying to convince your parents that eating a chocolate swiss roll from a plastic wrapper was a good idea.\n\nAt some point, I feel like every person on the planet should experience the satisfaction of peeling off a thin layer of semi-hardened chocolate ganache with their teeth before shoving an absurdly large hunk of soft, chocolate sponge cake and whipped cream into their mouth.\n\nIf you haven’t had a similar soulful experience yet, we need to change that, because this might be one of the few throwbacks to childhood that won’t make you cringe. This homemade version is worth the couple of hours it takes to prepare, bake, and chill. Not only because it’s chocolatey and rich, but because it can be customized to add your favorite nuts, chips, or even fresh fruits.",

Set the oven to 400°F. You’ll have the sugar in the oven while it preheats and remove it from the oven when it is warm to the touch, in step 4.\nWhisk the eggs in a stand mixer:\nWhile the sugar is warming, use a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment to lightly beat the eggs, at low speed, until they look foamy with small bubbles, for 30 to 45 seconds.\nHow to Convert Stand Mixer Instructions to a Hand Mixer (and Vice Versa)\nREAD MORE:\nAdd the sugar to the eggs:\nBy now, the sugar should be warm to the touch. Remove the pan from the oven, hold the parchment paper by the sides and, while the mixer is still running, sprinkle the warm sugar into the eggs, followed by the salt.\n\nOnce all of the sugar has been added to the eggs, increase the mixer’s speed to medium-high.
