      "description": "Not a day goes by that I don’t eat a little chocolate. Usually, I savor a square of dark chocolate after dinner, but in the summer I crave a bite-sized chocolate frozen treat. Cue frozen chocolate-covered bananas: two bites of sweet and creamy banana enrobed in a thin dark chocolate shell. I like to make chocolate-covered bananas in the afternoon so that they are ready in time for an after-dinner treat.",
      "method": "Cover a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper. Add 2 inches of water to a double boiler or small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the water is simmering, turn the heat down to low. Meanwhile, peel the bananas, trim the ends, and slice them into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange evenly spaced on the sheet pan. Wipe off the knife and cutting board and finely chop the chocolate. Add the chopped chocolate and canola oil to a small heatproof glass or metal bowl that fits snugly over the pan of simmering water. Place the bowl on top of the pot of water and use a flexible spatula to stir the chocolate until melted and no solids remain, about 2 minutes. Coat the tines of a fork in melted chocolate and set a slice of banana on top. Use a flexible spatula or spoon to spoon chocolate over the banana slice, completely covering it. Nudge the banana slice to the front of the fork and scrape the bottom of the fork against the side of the bowl, removing excess chocolate.",
