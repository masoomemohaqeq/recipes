      "description": "Not a day goes by that I don’t eat a little chocolate. Usually, I savor a square of dark chocolate after dinner, but in the summer I crave a bite-sized chocolate frozen treat. Cue frozen chocolate-covered bananas: two bites of sweet and creamy banana enrobed in a thin dark chocolate shell. I like to make chocolate-covered bananas in the afternoon so that they are ready in time for an after-dinner treat.",
      "method": "Cover a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper. Add 2 inches of water to a double boiler or small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the water is simmering, turn the heat down to low. Meanwhile, peel the bananas, trim the ends, and slice them into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange evenly spaced on the sheet pan. Wipe off the knife and cutting board and finely chop the chocolate. Add the chopped chocolate and canola oil to a small heatproof glass or metal bowl that fits snugly over the pan of simmering water. Place the bowl on top of the pot of water and use a flexible spatula to stir the chocolate until melted and no solids remain, about 2 minutes. Coat the tines of a fork in melted chocolate and set a slice of banana on top. Use a flexible spatula or spoon to spoon chocolate over the banana slice, completely covering it. Nudge the banana slice to the front of the fork and scrape the bottom of the fork against the side of the bowl, removing excess chocolate.",

      "description": "Although you don’t need a wok for egg foo young, a wok is the best vessel for this recipe. Since woks have a small base with steep walls, this allows the egg foo young to shallow fry without adding too much oil. Since the base is smaller than a frying pan, it also helps prevent the omelet from spreading too quickly and thinly.",
      "method": "In a small saucepan, add the beef stock, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, and white pepper powder over medium heat. Whisk together and bring to a simmer. \n\nCombine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk to dissolve. Add to the saucepan and whisk until the gravy thickens and coats the back of the spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover the saucepan with a lid and keep it warm on the lowest possible heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until dissolved. Add the eggs, salt, and sugar. Whisk until well combined and there are no more egg white clumps. \n\nAdd the green onion, bean sprouts, and shrimp. Stir until everything is evenly coated.",
